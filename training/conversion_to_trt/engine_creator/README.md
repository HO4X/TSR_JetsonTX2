# Conversion to Nvidias TensorRT
This cpp code takes an UFF file and creates an engine file. 
This engine file can be loaded from the final TSR-Jetson application. 

# Note: this is a little bit tricky, as you need to setup TensorRT correctly as well as OpenCV! You might have to change the CMakeLists File!
